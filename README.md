Fintech bootcamp - calculating arbitrage profits in BTC on two cryptocurrency exchanges
# Looking for arbitrage on BTC Exchanges

This code outlines historical time periods where there were potentially opportunities to arbitrage the bitcoin price on two different bitcoin/cryptocurrency exchanges: Bitstamp and Coinbase. From that point we aim to narrow down certain days or timeframes that indicates a significant spread of BTC price between the two exchanges. This is over a broader timeframe of a few months in 2018. So from there we want to look at the spreads over a few different dates within that timeframe (Early, mid, late) to see how the spread might have changed over time. 

Then we calculate the total profits on the chosen dates.

All of those concepts are also plotted visually.

## Technologies

Jupyter lab and pandas made this excercise possible, along with matlib in order ot plot visuals. 

---

## Installation Guide

User will want to make sure that fire and questionary are installed. 

```python
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import Path
%matplotlib inline
```
User will need to be able to git bash to the appropriate folder with the notebook and open Jupyter Lab

```python
jupyter lab
```

## Usage

This was more of an exercise to look at a specific data set in the past and analyze how much profit could have been made via arbitrage. in theory the user could create use their own csv's with different data and update the code appropriately to read the data in the CSV.
